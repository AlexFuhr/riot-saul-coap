# Merged Pull Request: saul types

As of [#14][], we now support the following saul types:

- Humidity (`/hum`)
- Pressure (`/press`)
- Servo (`/servo`)
- Temperature (`/temp`)
- Voltage (`/voltage`)

# Merged Pull Request: Code Clean Up

We cleaned the code of this project.

- Replace function `make_msg` with `snprintf` ([#15][])
- Define type via context instead of wrapping handlers ([#13][])

# Merged Pull Request: router communication

With [#9][] the Makefile got updates, so that the project can be
connected to the RIOT router and receives a public IP address.

# Work in Progress

- Register to Raspberry Pi Resource Directory ([#14][])
- Enable `PUT` for actuator data ([#10][])
- Submit values via a defined cbor interface ([#12][])
- Encrypt CoAP with DTLS ([#18][])
